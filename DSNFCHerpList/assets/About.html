<p>The San Francisco State University has a beautiful green campus with a variety of plants trees and shrubs.All of the plants included in this guide are grown and cared for in the gardens of San Francisco State University.</p>

<p>The SFSU Trees and Shrubs (SFSUTnS) app facilitates the following purposes:
	<ul>
		<li> Lists the Trees and Shrubs present on campus.
		<li> Provides information about each plant.
		<li> Provides directions on Google Maps to find and locate each plant.
		<li> Allows field identification and collection of personal observation data.

	</ul>
</p>

<p>Two tab bar buttons are used to access field identification tools: Common Names and Scientific Names.The Common Names tab displays the complete SFSUTnS List of plants in the chosen category by their Common Names.The Scientific Names tab displays a list of  of all plants in the chosen category organized alphabetically by their Scientific Name, with a standard search bar to restrict the plant names displayed.</p>


<p>Once a specific plant has been selected, the plant's detailed view is displayed containing both scientific name name and common name and a photograph.</p>

<p> The Find button is used to locate the selected plant on a Map and to get directions to the location of the plant on Google Maps. If the plant is known to grow at two locations on campus, the user is given the option to choose one location before directions are provided.</p>

<p>The Observe button in the upper right of the navigation bar is used to collect personal observation data.Personal observation data includes the scientific name and common name of the plant,the time and date of the observation, and optionally a photograph (the camera button is located in the upper right of this view). The Save Observation button is used to save a copy of this information to the onBoard SQLite database.</p>

<p>Observations are displayed using the Observations tab bar button. Individual observations can be deleted using the standard editing controls. A more detailed description of each observation, including a photograph if one was taken for this observation, is displayed by selecting the disclosure indicator next to the observation list item. Observations can be shared via email, Twitter and Facebook (the share icon is in the upper right corner of the observation view).</p> 

<p>This software was developed at San Francisco State University by Neethi Elizabeth Joseph under the supervision of Prof. Marguerite Murphy, Computer Science Department.</p>
